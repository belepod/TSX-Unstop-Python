1. Script to Calculate Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle

# Script to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle using variables
length = 5
width = 3
area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
# area = 15, perimeter = 16
This script assigns values to length and width, then calculates the area and perimeter using the relevant formulas.

2. Script to Compare Two Numbers

# Script that takes two numbers as input and prints comparison result
num1 = 7
num2 = 10
if num1 > num2:
    result = "The first number is greater than the second number."
elif num1 < num2:
    result = "The first number is less than the second number."
else:
    result = "The first number is equal to the second number."
# result = "The first number is less than the second number."
This script compares two numbers and prints whether the first is greater, less than, or equal to the second.

3. Script to Check for Leap Year

# Script to check if a given year is a leap year
year = 2024
is_leap_year = (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)
# is_leap_year = True
This script checks if a year is a leap year using the correct logic for leap years.

5. Script to Concatenate Two Strings

# Script that concatenates two strings and prints the result
string1 = "Hello, "
string2 = "world!"
result = string1 + string2
# result = "Hello, world!"
This script combines two strings and prints the result.
